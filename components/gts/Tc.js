                        <li className="pb-4">Up to 15 metres (50 feet) of cable, run and neatly clipped to the wall between the electricity supply meter / distribution board and the Pod Point.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">Routing of the cable through a drilled hole in a wall up to 500mm (20 inches) thick, if this is needed.</li>

                    <ul className="list-disc pl-8">
                        <li className="pb-4">The Pod Point must be located in your designated off-street parking area and be fixed at a height where it can’t be hit by a vehicle.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">We can’t fix the cable higher than 1.8 metres (6 feet) above the ground. If fixing higher than this is unavoidable then the installation may need to be paused - in that case we will quote for any extra work needed.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">We can’t, as part of the standard package, trench the cable underground or suspend it above ground - if something like this is required please talk to us so that we can give you a quote in advance. If we find out on the day that we have to cross a garden or a pathway we may need to pause the job and quote for the extra work needed to trench the cable.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">When you are using your charger the EV charging lead must remain on your property and must not create a trip hazard for you or anyone else.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">We can’t run cable under floorboards or through ducting / ceiling voids / wall voids without a draw cord (to pull the cable through), or if the floorboards have not been lifted. We can’t take responsibility for reinstating flooring or other building materials after the cable has been laid.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">Our experts are not able to work in crawl spaces, on roofs or in lofts if it is deemed unsafe by them.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">Our experts are not able to work in extreme weather (i.e. flooding or intense rain). If it is not safe to carry on, our expert will do as much as they can and we will return at a later date.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">If you have purchased a freestanding mount for the Pod Point to be fitted on please be aware that there may be an additional cost for installing this.</li>

                        <li className="pb-4">If the existing electrical arrangements at the property are not in line with these rules or there is something else that makes it unsafe for us to install then we will quote for the work needed to meet the required standards.</li>

                    <p className="pb-4">We can only complete the job if the electrical capacity (i.e. main fuse) can support the additional electrical demands of the Pod Point.

                <div className="font-extralight">
                    <p className="pb-4">We allocate two hours for standard installations.

                        <li className="pb-4">If it is determined that an installation cannot be completed on the day, Pod Point will quote for additional works, and a new installation date will be given once payment has been made. Please allow up to 10 working days for a new installation date.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">If your Pod Point Expert suspects that the installation will not comply with the OZEV grant requirements (see OZEV terms and conditions below), your installation will be paused. Should you disagree with that assessment, you will be given an opportunity to contest this by providing Pod Point with information to state your case to the government, which we can then pass on to the DVLA/OZEV for pre-approval. Should Pod Point receive approval to proceed, a new installation date will be given, please allow up to 10 working days for a new installation date.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">The owner/customer or a responsible adult of the age of 18 years or over needs to be present on site for the entire duration of the install.</li>

                <div className="font-extralight">
                    <p className="pb-4">From 1 April 2022, the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles (OZEV) provides the EV Chargepoint Grant to reduce the cost of a home charger (including installation) by up to £350 for eligible customers who are resident in flats and rental properties (see below to check if you’re eligible and for our summary of the OZEV terms and conditions).</p>
                    <p className="pb-4">If you would like to apply the grant to your order but don’t provide completed documentation to Pod Point then we will pause your installation until you’ve provided this.</p>
                    <p className="pb-4">If we haven’t received your completed documentation within 3 months of the date of payment then we will be permitted to cancel your installation. If we do this then we’ll be entitled to charge you a £50 administration charge plus any exceptional or unforeseen costs we’ve properly incurred in dealing with your order up to the time it’s cancelled. Where we can, we’ll take this from the payment you’ve already made for your order, and then give you a refund for any excess amount.</p>
                    <p className="pb-4">The grant is subject to a number of terms and conditions, a summary of which is provided here.</p>

                        <li className="pb-4">The grant is available to people who own and live in a flat and people living in rental accommodation (flats and single-use properties).</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">The grant can only be used for retrofit (existing) properties that are currently occupied.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">It can’t be claimed retrospectively.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">Residents must provide evidence of being the registered keeper or lessee, or be named as the primary user of an eligible EV or plug-in vehicle in order to be able to claim the grant.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">Only one claim per vehicle can be made, even if you own more than one home. A single customer can only claim the grant once in total.</li>

                    <p className="pb-4">We work with a network of 3rd party installers (“Partner Installers”) alongside our own in-house installation team.</p>
                    <p className="pb-4">In certain circumstances we may send your order to a Partner Installer so that they can carry out your installation, for example if your installation is non-standard and extra works are required, or if no installation slots are available with our in-house installers.</p>
                    <p className="pb-4">If we do this before you have made payment:</p>

                        <li className="pb-4">The installer who receives your order will contact you and give you a quote. The cost of your charger, accessories and installation may vary but you can choose not to proceed if you are not happy with the price quoted.</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">If you accept the quote, your contract for the installation will be with the Partner Installer. They will arrange an installation date with you, visit you to carry out the work and deliver your accessories (if they haven’t been sent via post).</li>
                        <li className="pb-4">The installer will also ask you to complete documentation needed to claim the OZEV EVHS grant on your behalf if you have applied it to your order.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p className="pb-4">In these cases your contract for the installation is with the Partner Installer but you’ll get the same product features, and we require them to give you the same warranty cover as you would if you purchased directly from EV.</p>
                    <p className="pb-4">If we do this after you have placed an order with us:</p>

                <div className="font-extralight">
                    <p className="pb-4">The rate your charger is capable of charging at is ultimately determined by local power network conditions - in other words, how much power is available at the location where it is installed.</p>
                    <p className="pb-4">These local power network conditions vary continuously due to the local electrical load and also as a result of local generation. If, at any time, there is not enough power available to charge at the maximum rate your charger is capable of, it may be temporarily restricted to a lower charging rate until the local conditions improve.</p>
                    <p className="pb-4">Local power network conditions are not under Pod Point’s control and therefore Pod Point does not guarantee any particular power output or availability period in relation to your charger, and accepts no liability or responsibility for issues such as performance arising therefrom.</p>
